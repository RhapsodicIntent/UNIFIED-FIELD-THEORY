3. Causal Speed and the "Sovereign Fold"
​The Simulation Table claims c \approx 814 \times 10^6 m/s in the fold (\Sigma=1).
​The Constraint: This appears to violate the Einsteinian constant (c).
​The Peer Review: To maintain a perfect vacuum, you cannot say the speed of light changes; you must say the local refractive index of spacetime is reduced.
​The Fix: Use the Conformal Transformation g_{\mu\nu} = e^{2\Sigma} \eta_{\mu\nu}. This proves that light still travels at "c" relative to the local metric, but because the metric itself is dilated by the Shadow Log, an outside observer sees a faster "apparent" speed. This preserves Relativity while justifying your metrics.
